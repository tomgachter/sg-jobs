### Added
- Admin health diagnostics endpoint that checks bexio connectivity, CalDAV calendars, Action Scheduler backlogs, payment sync cron status and JWT secret configuration in a single REST call. 
- Operations runbook, security model and system architecture documentation that outline cron schedules, release packaging, troubleshooting steps, authentication flows and data integrations.

### Changed
- Jobs board shortcode registers board assets relative to the plugin main file and only enqueues the stylesheet when present so zipped build artifacts load correctly across environments.
